# camunda
This project contains a simple example of bpmn.js integration on Angular 7 which have a tecnnical issue when the applicatio is built for production with code optimization.

Here is the details to reproduce the issue.

**Structure of project:**
*  **POC-CamundaModeler**: Contains applications which displays the BPMN diagram.
*  **builds**: Contains the binary generated by the differents configuration defined in angular.json file.
*  **imgs**: Contains screenshots of errors

To reproduce the issue, follow the following steps:

*   **Step 1:** Clone the repository.

*   **Step 2:** Download the libraries with the following command (Yarn already installed):
> yarn install

*   **Step 3:** Build the project with 'production-optimized' configuration with the following command:
> ng build --configuration=production-optimized

*   **Step 4:** Install an HTTP server and deploy the build on it:
> yarn global install http-server
> http-server ./dist/POC-CamundaModeler/

*   **Step 5:** Open your browser on 'BPMN viewer demo' tabsheet.
The BPMN diagram is not displayed and the following error appears on the console:

    ERROR TypeError: this._createContainer is not a function
        at xl.nt (Viewer.js.pre-build-optimizer.js:122)
        at new xl (Modeler.js.pre-build-optimizer.js:129)
        at t._next (bpmn-viewer.component.ts:33)
        at t.__tryOrUnsub (Subscriber.js.pre-build-optimizer.js:196)
        at t.next (Subscriber.js.pre-build-optimizer.js:134)

        at t.next (Subscriber.js.pre-build-optimizer.js:54)
        at t._next (filter.js.pre-build-optimizer.js:38)


Notice that application is working well when application is built with :

*  buildOptimizer = **false** &  optimization = **false** ( *ng build --configuration=production-not-optimized* )
*  buildOptimizer = **false** &  optimization = **true**  ( *ng build --configuration=production-optimized* )
*  buildOptimizer = **true**  &  optimization = **false** ( *ng build --configuration=production-buildoptimizer* )

but not workking when buildOptimizer and optimization are both true with following command:
*  *ng build --configuration=production-optimized*
or
*  *ng build --configuration=production-full*

Why???
